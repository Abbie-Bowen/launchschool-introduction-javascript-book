//1. Write a personalized greeter program
// let name = prompt('What is your name?');

//
// //2. make it ask for first and last names
// let firstName = prompt('What is your first name?');
// let lastName = prompt('What is your last name?');

//3. modify the age.js program to ask users to enter their age.
let age = Number(prompt('How old are you?'));
console.log(`You are ${age} years old.`);
console.log(`In 10 years, you will be ${age + 10} years old.`);
